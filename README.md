# freedoom-music-packs
These are my personal music packs that I use for FREEDOOM 0.13.0 with the [Crispy Doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom) engine.

I've taken the audio from these recordings of the FREEDOOM 0.13.0 OST:
[Phase 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3YyyCKOiM8)
[Phase 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYbIVaztcaA)

I've uploaded them here so that I can automatically download and install them in my NixOS configuration.

Cheeky, I know.
